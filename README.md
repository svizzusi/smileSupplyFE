3. **Explore Your Profile on the Dashboard**: Inside the intuitive dashboard, you have an "Add Product" button that brings up a module.

   ![Add product](https://github.com/svizzusi/smileSupplyFE/assets/121833017/92b9e6a0-ddeb-49db-85b7-44a4247b7bee)

   You can enter the Name, Price, quantity, and frequency that you want to order the item so that the algorithm can send you reorder reminders a week prior to running out so that you can add it to the order form, see if you are within budget, and submit the order.

   ![Add product toggle off](https://github.com/svizzusi/smileSupplyFE/assets/121833017/388951c7-4489-4851-8aa0-186e26d72127)

   If the item is not a recurring item, simply use the toggle, and no reminders will be sent to the reorder reminder, but it will remain in your existing product inventory and can be easily sent to the order form with a click of the "shopping cart" button.

   ![Add to order](https://github.com/svizzusi/smileSupplyFE/assets/121833017/8596a68c-fdc9-4ca9-b167-ce9019281069)

4. **Existing Products Page (Accessed from the Existing Products button on the dashboard)**: This is a hub for all the products that you have ever ordered, even those that do not have a frequency to reorder. This page keeps track of your current inventory and allows you to access product information, price, and quantity of items. The user-friendly interface allows you to easily add items directly to the order form with a click of the "shopping cart" icon.

   ![Add to order form](https://github.com/svizzusi/smileSupplyFE/assets/121833017/91fbb41b-b003-41b7-b4c2-fbd8c538dbb9)

5. **Order Form Page**: This page contains all of the items that you have added to your virtual "shopping cart" from either the reorder reminder section on the dashboard or on the existing products page. This page totals up the current costs of all items added so that you can make sure that your order is within budget. With a simple click on the product ID number, the information is stored on the clipboard where it can easily be pasted into your supplier website.

   ![Clipboard](https://github.com/svizzusi/smileSupplyFE/assets/121833017/d0cc9809-943e-4b31-9b75-69ed4fae5e23)

   Start by selecting the product you need, and with a single click, it's copied to your clipboard and highlighted in tan, ensuring you don't double up on items. Next, hop over to your preferred supplier's website and paste the product ID to add it to your shopping cart – no more manual data entry hassles. Repeat this for each item on your order list, and when you're done, simply hit the "Clear Order Form" button on Smile Supply. This action resets product order frequencies to your specified preferences and readies the form for your next order. Streamline your dental inventory management with Smile Supply – it's that easy! Enjoy the convenience of a well-organized and efficient ordering process.
